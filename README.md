# DonoTracker
A donation tracking bot built in BDFD language.
There also may be multiple part commands, or commands with the same name. If you just make the bot and add them all as they are it should work fine.

# Variables
There is a list of all the variables in the VARIABLES file. All you need to do is add them exactly as they are. For example: donos, value=0. Put the name as donos and the value as 0. IF THE VALUE IS BLANK IT IS NOT A MISTAKE. If you run into a variable that looks like this: logs, value= then it is blank. Just do not put anything in for the value when you add it.

# Notice
This project is not finished, and only released to be added onto. If you use it and make a bot out of it, make sure to tell me! It would be fun seeing it finished.
